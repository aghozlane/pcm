## Introduction

PCM is a generic method using homology modelling to increase the specificity of functional prediction of proteins, especially
when they are distantly related from proteins for which a function is known. The principle of PCM is to
build structural models and assess their relevance using a specific training approach. PCM uses the
list of sequences of reference proteins from a given family, the structures related to this family (they
will be used as structural templates in the PDB format) and a series of negative references.
The pcm process follow this dag:

## Usage

PCM is available on [galaxy](https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/) in section Microbiome_analysis/PCM.
A tutorial is available [here](example/PCM_in_galaxy.pdf). This version is restrained to investigate a catalogue of 100,000 proteins.

## Installation

PCM is deployed using [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) and nextflow.
To install singularity on a Linux platform, follow these commands:
```
VERSION=2.5.2
wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$VERSION/singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd singularity-$VERSION
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
```
It is recommanded to install singularity as root. NEWUSER namespace runtime error can occur on Red Hat system when singularity is installed by an user (see  https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/415).
Download PCM singularity image (warning: the file is heavy ~ 1Go):
```
wget ftp://shiny01.hosting.pasteur.fr/pub/pcm_202001.img
```
Install nextflow:
```
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

## Running PCM

### Start

For this example we will search resistance genes in the proteome of the following species:
<img src="example/phylogeny.png" align="center" />
This set was obtained from NCBI. The computation can be performed with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aghozlane/pcm.git
cd pcm
# See help with
nextflow pcm.nf --help
# Run example calculation
nextflow pcm.nf  --in example/example_proteome.faa --out result -w work/ -with-singularity pcm_201909.img
```


### Command line options


```
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 19.01.0
Launching `pcm.nf` [happy_blackwell] - revision: b2185a98ff
pcm.nf --in <fasta_file> --out <output_dir> --cpus <nb_cpus> -w <temp_work_dir>
--in Multifasta file containing protein sequence (default /pasteur/homes/aghozlan/pcm/example/example_proteome.faa).
--out Output directory (default /pasteur/homes/aghozlan/pcm/example/res).
--cpu Number of cpus for homology modeling processing (default 6)
--cpu_candidates Number of cpus for candidates search (default 12)
--family Select the family to consider (default aac2,aac3_1,aac3_2,aac6,ant,aph,arnm,blaa,blab1,blab3,blac,blad,dfra,erm,fos,ldt,mcr,qnr,sul,tetM,tetX,van)
--hfinder_evalue E-value threshold to search candidates (default 0.00001)
--modelling_quality Level of quality of the homology modelling fast, normal or high (default fast)
--model Number of model calculated (default 6)
--template Number of template for modelling (default 3)
--bootstrap Number of bootstrap calculated during statistical analysis (default 10)
```

#### Option --in

PCM takes as input a fasta file containing protein sequence. They must follow this next format:
```
>ID1
MNTFGQIHNNMPYLFLLAFIMNFYDQFNNSISGQEMCYEVESI
FNNHQVDIIGAPAAAFKPLELQKGLGTKGAIVNYPILQVTGNI
>ID2
MNTFGQIHNNMPYLFLLAFIMNFYDQFNNSISGQEMCYEVESI
FNNHQVDIIGAPAAAFKPLELQKGLGTKGAIVNYPILQVTGNI
```
The ID is >name (without any space or point in the name).

#### Option --family

One or several ARD families can be investigated. User must indicate the selected family as follow: --family family1,family2. By default, PCM allows to screen the ARD families of clinical interest. All current possibilities are indicated here: aac2,aac3_1,aac3_2,aac6,ant,aph,arnm,blaa,blab1,blab3,blac,blad,dfra,erm,fos,ldt,mcr,qnr,sul,tetM,tetX,van

#### Option --hfinder_evalue

Set the E-value threshold for candidate selection. This threshold impacts the candidates selection. A high e-value will select more candidates for PCM.


#### Option --modelling_quality

Select the quality level of the modelisation. A high level of modelling quality will make PCM to spend more time to improve the protein model. By default, the mode fast is enough to predict an ARD.

#### Option --model

Select the number of model to calculate for modelling step. The homology modelling is a heuristic approach where the starting point is crucial. A high number of model corresponds to a high number of different start. By default, the number of model is set to 6 which is enough to screen the set of possibilities.

#### Option --template

Select the number of template to consider for modelling step. Setting this parameter higher makes the PCM more precise with a risk of overfitting. However some ARDs families do not have more than 3 ARD templates (notably MCR).

#### Option --bootstrap

Select the number of bootstrap to calculate for candidate classification. Setting this higher makes the classification more precise with an increase of calculation time.

### Singularity

The usage of singularity with Nextflow requires that the input data/result/work to be accessible in the virtual image. If you do not set your calculation in your home folder, you might need to explain to nextflow where it can mount this space, like here:
```
#nextflow config file
singularity {
            enabled = true
            autoMounts = false
            runOptions = '--bind  /mnt:/home'
}
# the directory /mnt that contains my data is mounted in the singularity
# on its home directory

# Do not run
# You can then provide this configuration like this:
nextflow pcm.nf  --in example/example_proteome.faa --out result -w work/ -with-singularity pcm_201909.img -c nextflow.config
```
More information about nextflow and singularity are available [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html).

### Cluster configuration

Nextflow uses a configuration file to deploy computation on cluster, an example of this file is available [here](nextflow_global.config).
This file enables the usage of singularity on a slurm scheduler and need to be adjusted for each cluster configuration. Profiles are activated with the command (-profile singularity  -c nextflow_global.config).
```
# The profile singularity correspond to an execution on a cluster environment
profiles{
    singularity {
        process.container = 'file:///pasteur/homes/aghozlan/pcm/img/pcm_202001.img'
        singularity.enabled = true
        singularity.autoMounts = false
        singularity.runOptions = "-B /pasteur:/pasteur"
        process.executor = 'slurm'
        process.clusterOptions='--qos=hubbioit'
        process.queue = 'hubbioit'
    }
}
# Do not run
# You can then provide this configuration like this:
nextflow pcm.nf  --in example/example_proteome.faa --out result -w work/ -with-singularity pcm_202001.img -c nextflow_global.config -profile singularity
```
In the profile singularity, I indicate where is the container (with process.container). I mount data directory with singularity.runOptions (the path are here indicatives). I select the type of scheduler (with executor) and our cluster option: the qos and the partition for hubbioit.



## Results

### PCM result

The PCM result file contains all the score collected on the protein structures and their difference (delta annotated with d_). 
Their is two type score in PCM:
    - Statistical potentials that describe the quality of a given model
    - Score of the structual alignment between the model and the reference or the negative reference

#### Model quality


The model quality is estimated by Modeller, Prosa and ProQ. Here is short description of the score provided by these softwares.

Score | Software | Description
---|---|---
molpdf | Modeller | Objective function optimized by Modeller
dope_score | Modeller |  The DOPE score of a random protein conformation is estimated by a weighted sum of protein composition over the 20 standard amino acid residue types, where each weight corresponds to the expected change in the score by inserting a specific type of amino acid residue. The weights are estimated from a separate training set of 1,686,320 models generated by MODPIPE.
normalized_dope | Modeller | The normalized DOPE score is derived from the statistics of raw DOPE scores.
GA341_score | Modeller | The GA341 score [Melo et al., 2002,John & Å ali, 2003] uses the percentage sequence identity between the template and the model as a parameter.
zscore | Prosa | Estimates the compatibility of a sequence with a given fold based on the knowledge base of 3D-structure available [[Sippl 1993](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340170404)].
maxsub | ProQ | Prediction of the MaxSub score performed by a neural network based on atom  and  residue  contacts,  solvent  accessibility,  similarity between the model secondary structure and the secondary structure predicted by Psispred.MaxSub, on the otherhand, divides the structural comparison score by the length of the correct target structure. 
lgscore | ProQ | Prediction of the Levitt-Gerstein (LG) score score performed by a neural network based on atom  and  residue  contacts,  solvent  accessibility,  similarity between the model secondary structure and the secondary structure predicted by Psispred.  LGscore uses  a  statistical  distribution  to  relate Sstr to the  probability  of finding a higher score by chance (P-value).


#### Quality of the structural alignment

Structural alignment softwares try to find  the  maximum  subset  of  similar  local  structures  thathave  their  corresponding  C-alpha close  in  cartesian  space. 
We align the model with the reference ARD that are used as templates by Modeller.

Score | Software | Description
---|---|---
Z-score_mammoth | Mammoth | The probability of obtaining the given proportion of aligned residues (with respect to the shortest protein model) by chance based  on  extreme-value fitting of the scores.
TM-score_mammoth | Mammoth | The Template Modeling score is variation of LG-Score, it reflects the distance between optimal aligned residues. See [[Zhang, Skolnick 2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/prot.20264)].
RMSD_TMalign | TM-align | Root Mean Square Distance between corresponding residues. 
TM-score_TMalign | TM-align | The Template Modeling score is variation of LG-Score, it reflects the distance between optimal aligned residues. See [[Zhang, Skolnick 2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/prot.20264)].


### Prediction output

The classification performed by PCM lies on the result of the SVM classification based on the different score mentionned ealier and on the TM-score which provides a clear estimatimation of the similarity of the model with a reference [[Zhang 2010](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/7/889/213219)]). The problem solved by PCM is essentially linear. We use a logistic regression to classify the best models from Modeller.
